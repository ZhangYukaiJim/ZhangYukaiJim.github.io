PIVOT is a multimodel control system for smart home appliances. The system allows users to specify a device with a pointing gesture before using a verbal command to control it, making the interaction more intuitive in rooms with multiple smart devices.

Collaborated with UX designers at TCL, I created a proof-of-concept prototype for the system with an RGB-D camera and helped integrate it into future TCL TVs. 

The project won the [2022 IF Design Award](https://ifdesign.com/en/winner-ranking/project/pivot-smarthome-experience/348572).
