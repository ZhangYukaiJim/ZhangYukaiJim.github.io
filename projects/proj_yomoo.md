title: 'YOMOO: A foldable personal mobility device'
---
***3rd Year Project at ISD***\\
***Collaborated with Sida CHEN and Jiakun ZHENG***

The goal of the project is to design a personal mobility device that can be easily carried on public transportations. We designed and prototyped a three-wheel foldable electric bike inspired by tripods.
